### I'm Jaeden Amero

I like small computers.

You can visit [my personal website](https://patater.com/) to see what I've been
up to and for more in-depth explanations of my projects. You can find me on
[Twitter (@Patater)](https://twitter.com/Patater) or on
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patater/), too.

If you'd like to collaborate on something interesting, feel free to reach out.
